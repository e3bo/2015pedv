To run the R analysis script within a Docker container with the
necessary software environment, simply execute the run-scripts script
from the root directory of this git repository on a system with
[docker](https://docker.com) installed. The analysis output will be
placed in a time-stamped directory that begins with "work".

The docker image is available on
[dockerhub](https://dockerhub.com). Alternatively, you may request a
tar file of the image from the maintainer of the Dockerfile, which can
be loaded and then tagged using the "docker load" and "docker tag"
commands.
