1. Obtain a copy of JFlowmap with the custom color schemes I made, or
use version 0.16.6 from the [official
website](https://code.google.com/p/jflowmap/) if you don't care about
the colors.

2. Start up the program with the flows configuration in a directory
with the other files included in that configuration. Some of them are
included in the data directory of this repository and others get
produced by the mantel.r script.

  java -jar jflowmap.jar ./flow.jfmv

Note that "flow.jfmv" does not seem to be recognized as
"./flow.jfmv".

3. Open up the settings panel and turn off the end markers. Then
perform edge bundling with the default settings and export an svg. You
might have to adjust the view to get the legend to be the right size.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the crossCorrelation.jfmv input file.

5. Create the final figure using Inkscape to import the components,
arrange them, and export PDF and PS.
